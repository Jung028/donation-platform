  Charity Platform Dashboard - Main HTML Template
  
  This is the main HTML template for the Charity Platform Dashboard frontend application.
  It serves as the entry point for the React application and provides the basic
  structure and metadata for the web application.
  
  The actual content of the application is dynamically rendered by React into
  the root div element. This file primarily contains metadata, links to resources,
  and the base HTML structure.
