AI Damage Detector API

This module implements a Flask web application that provides an API for
detecting damage in images using machine learning. The application will
eventually use a trained model to identify and classify damage in uploaded images.

This is part of the charity platform ecosystem, designed to help assess
damage for disaster relief efforts and insurance claims processing.
